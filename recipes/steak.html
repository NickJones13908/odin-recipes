        <li>vegetable oil, soy sauce, red wine vinegar, lemon juice and ground black pepper.</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>There are plenty of ways to perfectly cook a flank steak. In this recipe, the steak is grilled â€” we love the bold, 
        smoky flavor the grill gives the meat. But you can also easily cook your flank steak in the oven or on the stove. 
        You'll find the step-by-step recipe for marinated and grilled flank steak below, but here are some 
        rough guidelines for three different flank steak cooking methods:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the grill: Season and marinate the steak according to your recipe. Preheat a lightly oiled outdoor grill to medium-high 
            heat. Remove the steak from the marinade, shake off excess liquid, and grill on each side to desired doneness. 
            The steak is done when a 
            meat thermometer inserted into the center reads between 130 degrees F and 145 degrees F.</li>
        <li>In the oven: Season and marinate the steak according to your recipe. Remove the steak from the marinade, 
            shake off excess liquid, and arrange the steaks in a baking dish lined with aluminum foil. Bake until a meat
             thermometer inserted into the center of the steak reads between 130 degrees F and 145 degrees F.</li>
    </ul>
